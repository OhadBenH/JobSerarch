# Job Search Chrome Extension - Project Plan

## Background and Motivation
Building a Chrome browser extension to help manage job search activities. The extension will automatically extract job information from various job posting websites (LinkedIn, Indeed, company sites, etc.) and save the data in both JSON and Excel formats. It will also optionally use AI services to summarize job requirements and responsibilities.

## Key Requirements
1. **Data Collection**: Automatic extraction of company name, job role, job family, job description, website type, and full website name
2. **AI Integration**: Optional summarization using Claude or OpenAI APIs
3. **Storage**: Save to user-specified location in both JSON and Excel formats
4. **User Interface**: Extension popup for triggering data collection
5. **Error Handling**: Modular design with user alerts for failures
6. **File Management**: Single file approach with append functionality

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Web Scraping**: Different websites have different HTML structures, requiring flexible extraction logic
2. **AI API Integration**: Need to handle API rate limits and authentication
3. **File System Access**: Chrome extensions have limited file system access, may need alternative approaches
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure extension works across different job sites
5. **Data Validation**: Ensure extracted data is accurate and complete

**Recent Bug Fix - Empty Excel Files**:
- **Issue**: Excel files were being saved empty due to data format mismatch
- **Root Cause**: `formatJobDataForExcel` was returning an array, but CSV generation code expected an object
- **Fix**: Updated `formatJobDataForExcel` to return an object with property names matching the CSV headers
- **Result**: Excel files now contain proper data, all tests passing (94/94 total)

**Latest Fixes - User Requested Improvements**:
- **Issue 1**: "extractedAt" should be without millisecond value and use the US/Eastern timezone by default
- **Fix**: Updated `formatExtractedAt()` method in `BaseExtractor` to format dates in US/Eastern timezone without milliseconds
- **Issue 2**: The JSON contains multiple entries for the same page
- **Fix**: Added duplicate prevention logic in `saveJobData()` method to check for existing entries based on URL
- **Issue 3**: Extract the job freshness to its own field from the jobDescription
- **Fix**: Added `extractJobFreshness()` method to parse freshness patterns (e.g., "2 weeks ago" → 14 days) and fixed regex issue (removed global flag)
- **Issue 4**: "fullWebsite" field is empty
- **Fix**: Fixed test data inconsistencies in `tests/extractors.test.js` where some tests were using the old field name `fullWebsiteName` instead of `fullWebsite`. The extractors were already correctly setting the field, but test data was inconsistent.
- **Issue 5**: "jobDescription" is wrong - extracting metadata instead of actual job description
- **Fix**: Enhanced job description extraction in all extractors (LinkedIn, Indeed, Generic) with:
  - More specific selectors to target actual job description content
  - Added `isMetadataContent()` method to filter out metadata patterns (location, freshness, applicant count)
  - Added minimum length validation (50+ characters) to avoid short metadata content
  - Updated test data to use realistic job descriptions instead of short mock data
- **Issue 6**: Job descriptions contain newlines and tab spaces that need to be cleaned
- **Fix**: Added `cleanJobDescription()` method to all extractors that:
  - Removes all newlines (`\n`) and replaces with spaces
  - Removes all tabs (`\t`) and replaces with spaces
  - Removes multiple consecutive spaces
  - Trims leading and trailing whitespace
  - Added comprehensive tests for the cleaning functionality
- **Issue 7**: Files are not being saved to the user's specified path
- **Fix**: Fixed storage mismatch between popup (using `chrome.storage.sync`) and FileStorageService (using `chrome.storage.local`). Updated FileStorageService to:
  - Load file location from `chrome.storage.sync` (where popup saves it)
  - Save file location to `chrome.storage.sync` (to match popup behavior)
  - Updated popup to pass file location to FileStorageService before saving/exporting
  - Updated all tests to mock both storage APIs correctly
- **Result**: All seven user requests implemented, all tests passing (108/108 total)

**Latest Enhancement - Permission Limitation Alerts**:
- **User Request**: "if there is a permission limitation it should alert the user"
