# Chrome Web Store Publishing Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the process of publishing your Job Search Manager Chrome extension to the Google Web Store.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Google Developer Account
- Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/)
- Sign in with your Google account
- Pay the one-time $5.00 USD registration fee (if you haven't already)
- Complete the developer account setup

### 2. Extension Preparation
Your extension is already well-prepared for publishing with:
- ✅ Manifest V3 (required for new extensions)
- ✅ Proper permissions and host permissions
- ✅ Complete icon set (16, 32, 48, 128px)
- ✅ Comprehensive functionality
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

## Step-by-Step Publishing Process

### Step 1: Package Your Extension

1. **Create a ZIP file** containing all extension files:
   ```
   JobSearchManager.zip
   ├── manifest.json
   ├── popup.html
   ├── popup.js
   ├── content.js
   ├── background.js
   ├── extractors.js
   ├── file-storage.js
   ├── jobs-table.html
   ├── jobs-table.js

   ├── persistent-window.js
   └── icons/
       ├── icon16.png
       ├── icon32.png
       ├── icon48.png
       └── icon128.png
   ```

2. **Ensure no unnecessary files** are included (like test files, README, etc.)

### Step 2: Upload to Chrome Web Store

1. **Go to Developer Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/
   - Click "Add new item"

2. **Upload your ZIP file**:
   - Drag and drop or browse to select your ZIP file
   - Wait for upload to complete

### Step 3: Fill Out Store Listing

#### Basic Information
- **Extension name**: "Job Search Manager"
- **Short description**: "Extract and manage job information from LinkedIn, Indeed, and other job sites with AI-powered summarization"
- **Detailed description**: Use the content from your README.md file

#### Category and Type
- **Category**: "Productivity"
- **Type**: "Extension"

#### Language

**Icon**:
- Your existing 128x128 icon will be used

### Step 4: Privacy and Permissions

#### Privacy Policy
You'll need a privacy policy. Create a simple one covering:
- What data you collect (job information, user settings)
- How you use it (local storage, file export)
- Third-party services (OpenAI/Claude APIs)
- Data retention (local storage only)

#### Permissions Justification
Be prepared to explain each permission:

- `scripting`: To inject content scripts
- `windows`: To create persistent windows

## Review Process

### Timeline
- **Initial review**: 1-3 business days
- **Re-review** (if changes needed): 1-2 business days

### Common Issues to Avoid

1. **Missing Privacy Policy**: Required for extensions that handle user data
2. **Insufficient Screenshots**: Must show actual functionality
3. **Vague Descriptions**: Be specific about what the extension does
4. **Permission Overreach**: Only request necessary permissions
